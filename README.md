## Description

# Week 3 homework project "Jets"
# This application creates a fleet of different class jets. All of the jets descriptions are kept in a text file in the project folder and it is read in when the user starts the application. The application presents a looping menu that allows the user to make the following selections:

# 1) List the fleet
# 2) Fly the aircrafts - includes submenu to select which aircraft to fly.
# 3) View the fastest jet
# 4) View the jet with the longest range
# 5) Load all the Cargo Jets
# 6) Dogfight! (All the fighter jets fight)
# 7) Add a jet to the Fleet - includes submenu to specify which type of jet they're adding.
# 8) Remove a jet from the Fleet
# 9) Quit





## Topics and Technologies
# Iterfaces

# Inheritance

# UML Diagram

# Conditionals (if/else/switch)

# Looping (while loops)

# Methods

# Encapsulation

# Objects and Classes

# Abstraction

# Polymorphism

# Object Oriented Programming


## Lessons Learned

# Classes can become confusing, easily if you do not keep UML up to date

# Dont try to become too ambitious. I tried to incorporate a Display image class and while i got it to run it causes an error when i include in the program. That is one of my personal stretch goals going forward.
